# Claudify Skills Library

> 1,737 skills across 31 categories, every one scored by the deterministic /skills-audit rubric.
> Tier counts below are generated at build time from the audit, never hand-typed.

## How Skills Work

Skills load automatically when Claude detects a relevant task. DEEP-tier skills
are additionally user-invocable as slash entries; scaffold-tier skills stay out
of the slash menu and load by model invocation only.

Tier meanings: DEEP = scored 85+ with a binary eval, the deliverable is the
output. STANDARD = 60 to 84. SHALLOW = structured scaffold, labeled as such.
BROKEN = unreachable or invalid, queued for prune. Rerun the numbers yourself
any time with /skills-audit.

## Quick Start

1. Ask Claude to perform the task; matching skills load automatically
2. DEEP-tier skills can also be invoked directly as slash entries
3. Skills read your project context automatically
4. Run /skills-audit for the scored report on your installed library

## Quality Standard

Every skill carries a version field and a generated, audited tier. DEEP-tier
skills ship with worked examples, a real artifact output block, and at least
one binary eval that fails the build if the skill stops producing its artifact.
