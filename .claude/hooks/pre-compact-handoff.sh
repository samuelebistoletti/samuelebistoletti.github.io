# PreCompact hook: fires before BOTH auto and manual compaction.
# It cannot block or alter the compaction summary (Claude Code controls that).
# Its job is to guarantee that a substantive handoff is on disk so the
# post-compaction session resumes sharp WITHOUT any user action.
#
# Design (the "always-warm handoff"):
#   - The agent keeps the daily note's latest "## Session Handoff" warm during
#     long work (operating rule in CLAUDE.md). That is the intelligent,
#     agent-authored handoff.
#   - This hook writes a substantive MECHANICAL fallback to .auto-handoff.md
#     every time compaction fires, so even an un-prepped session resumes with
#     real state, not just a marker.
#   - post-compact.sh (and the legacy SessionStart(compact) fallback) surfaces
#     the freshest of these.
# Fail-open: never blocks, always exits 0.
