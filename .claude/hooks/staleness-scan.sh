#!/bin/bash
# Decay ledger scanner (governed forgetting, read-only).
# Reads memory/.staleness.json (map of memory file -> ttl_class), compares
# each registered file's mtime and its newest dated [MMDDYY] entry stamp
# against the TTL, and emits a short report of STALE CANDIDATES.
#
# TTL classes: permanent (never flagged) | 90d | 14d.
# Registered paths may contain a glob (e.g. "memory/*.md"); the scanner
# expands it. Basenames starting with _ and the episodes/ and attic/
# subdirectories are always skipped.
#
# Invoked from /sync (one additive step) and safe to run manually:
#   bash .claude/hooks/staleness-scan.sh
#
# Guarantees:
#   - NEVER deletes, moves, or edits anything. Report only. The move is
#     /forget's job, behind explicit user confirmation.
#   - Report goes to stdout AND to .claude/logs/.staleness-report.md
#     (the file /forget reviews with the user).
#   - Always exits 0. Missing ledger, malformed JSON, or unparseable dates
#     degrade to a note in the report, never an error.
