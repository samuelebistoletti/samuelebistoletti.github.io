# PostCompact hook: restores context after compaction as a first-class event.
# Replaces the marker-file chain (pre-compact-handoff.sh writing
# .compaction-occurred + SessionStart(compact) reading it). No marker file,
# no stale state, no cross-session leaks.
#
# The SessionStart(compact) wiring is kept in settings.json for one release as
# a fallback for Claude Code versions without the PostCompact event; it is a
# no-op when this hook already consumed the marker. Remove in September.
#
# Fail-open: never blocks, never errors a session. Always exit 0.
