**Spawn synchronously:** every Agent/Task spawn in this procedure must pass `run_in_background: false`. Subagents default to background since Claude Code 2.1.198; this command consumes each subagent verdict before its next step, so a background spawn would race the verdict.

Turn a rough brief into a structured client proposal with scope, timeline, deliverables, and pricing.

## Steps

### Step 1: Gather the brief

If the user provided project details, use those. Otherwise, ask for:
- Client / project name
- What do they need? (the problem)
- What's the desired outcome?
- Any constraints (budget range, timeline, technical requirements)?

### Step 2: Scope definition

Break the project into phases and deliverables:

For each phase:
- **Phase name** and duration
- **Deliverables**, specific, tangible outputs
- **Dependencies**, what's needed to start this phase
- **Assumptions**, what you're assuming to be true

Flag anything that could cause scope creep. Be explicit about what's included and what isn't.

### Step 3: Timeline

Create a realistic timeline:
- Map phases to calendar weeks
- Identify milestones (decision points, reviews, handoffs)
- Build in buffer for feedback rounds
- Note any hard deadlines or dependencies on the client

### Step 4: Pricing

Structure the pricing:
- **Option A (Recommended):** Full scope as described
- **Option B:** Reduced scope (MVP / Phase 1 only)
- **Optional add-ons:** Additional services that complement the core work

For each option, list: total price, payment schedule, what's included, what's not.

### Step 5: Terms

Standard terms to include:
- Payment schedule and terms
- Revision policy (how many rounds of revisions)
- Ownership / IP transfer
- Timeline for acceptance / sign-off
- Cancellation terms

### Step 6: Write the proposal

Save to `proposals/[client-name]-proposal.md`:

```markdown
# Proposal, [Project Name]

**Prepared for:** [Client]
**Prepared by:** [Your name/company]
**Date:** [date]
